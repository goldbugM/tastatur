## Use License

*   _MKBoard_ is a free typing practice application that runs entirely in your web browser.
*   Permission is granted to temporarily use the Service for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only.

*   This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by _MKBoard_ at any time.

## Disclaimer

The typing practice application on _MKBoard_ is provided "as is". _MKBoard_ makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or nonâ€“infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, _MKBoard_ does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the typing practice application or any linked content.

## Limitations

_MKBoard_ reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.

## Accuracy of materials

In no event shall _MKBoard_ or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption,) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on _MKBoard_'s Internet site, even if _MKBoard_ or a _MKBoard_ authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
