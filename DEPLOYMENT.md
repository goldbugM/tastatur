# mkboard Deployment Guide

## Important: GitHub Pages Limitation

**‚ö†Ô∏è mkboard cannot be deployed to GitHub Pages** because it's a full-stack Node.js application that requires a server to run. GitHub Pages only serves static HTML/CSS/JavaScript files and doesn't support server-side applications.

## Why GitHub Pages Won't Work

1. **Server Requirement**: mkboard uses Node.js server-side rendering
2. **Database**: The application requires a database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)
3. **Dynamic Content**: Real-time features and user data processing
4. **API Endpoints**: Server-side API routes for user management and data

## Recommended Deployment Options

### 1. üöÄ Vercel (Recommended - Free Tier Available)

Vercel is perfect for Node.js applications and offers excellent performance:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel

# Follow the prompts to configure your deployment
```

**Benefits:**
- Free tier available
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Built-in CDN and performance optimization
- Easy custom domain setup

### 2. üåê Netlify (Alternative)

While primarily for static sites, Netlify supports serverless functions:

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod
```

### 3. ‚òÅÔ∏è Railway (Node.js Focused)

Railway specializes in Node.js deployments:

1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Railway automatically detects Node.js
3. Deploys with zero configuration

### 4. üê≥ Docker Deployment

Use the included Dockerfile for container deployment:

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t mkboard .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 mkboard
```

**Platforms supporting Docker:**
- Google Cloud Run
- AWS ECS
- Azure Container Instances
- DigitalOcean App Platform

### 5. üñ•Ô∏è VPS/Server Deployment

Deploy on any VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2):

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/goldbugM/mykboard.git
cd mykboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file for production:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
CANONICAL_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Build Process

The application builds to:
- `root/public/assets/` - Client-side assets (CSS, JS, images)
- `root/lib/` - Server-side compiled code

## Performance Optimization

For production deployment:

1. **Enable compression**: Built-in gzip/brotli compression
2. **CDN**: Use a CDN for static assets
3. **Database**: Use PostgreSQL for better performance
4. **Caching**: Configure Redis for session storage

## Monitoring and Analytics

Consider adding:
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring (New Relic)
- Analytics (Google Analytics)

## Custom Domain Setup

After deployment, configure your custom domain:

1. **DNS Configuration**: Point your domain to the deployment platform
2. **SSL Certificate**: Most platforms provide automatic SSL
3. **Canonical URL**: Update the `CANONICAL_URL` environment variable

## Next Steps

1. Choose a deployment platform from the options above
2. Set up environment variables
3. Configure your custom domain
4. Set up monitoring and analytics
5. Consider implementing CI/CD for automatic deployments

## Support

For deployment issues:
- Check the platform-specific documentation
- Review the application logs
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
